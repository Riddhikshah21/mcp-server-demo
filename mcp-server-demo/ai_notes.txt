Monkeys are divided into two main groups: Old World monkeys (found in Africa and Asia) and New World monkeys (found in Central and South America). New World monkeys often have prehensile tails that can grip branches, while Old World monkeys do not.
Capuchin monkeys are known for their intelligence and problem-solving abilities. They use tools in the wild, such as rocks to crack open nuts and sticks to extract insects from tree bark.
The smallest monkey species is the pygmy marmoset, which weighs only about 100 grams (3.5 ounces) and can fit in the palm of a human hand. They live in the Amazon rainforest.
Many monkey species live in complex social groups with hierarchies. They communicate through vocalizations, facial expressions, and body language, and some species have been observed displaying empathy and cooperation.
Howler monkeys have the loudest call of any land animal, which can be heard up to 3 miles (5 kilometers) away. They use these loud vocalizations to mark their territory and communicate with their troop across the dense rainforest.
